# Tissue enginnering is an artificial means to cure diseases
# It is also used as a substitute for organ transplantation
# Because of complication of organ transplantation, tissue engineering is widely accepted 
# Studies indicate that the concept of tissue engineering emerged after the successful
# implantation of a mouse tumor cell into a chick embryo
# Tissue engineering uses and synthesizes theories, principles, 
# and methods of bioengineering, material science, and life sciences for the production and restoration of tissues. 
# Tissue engineering uses cells, scaffold, and growth factor to regenerate new tissues. 
# Even if tissue engineering plays a major role in medical communities, its use in society is not yet widespread
# Tissue engineering can manufacture organs for bones, muscle, cardiovascular, digestive system, and so on. 
# Researchers are trying to solve nervous system diseases using tissue engineering
# There are also ethical concerns regarding the use of tissue engineering
# these are cell structures complexity, macthing engineered tissue and organs, and conducting human trials 
# Tisue engineering can be a solution or many diseases
