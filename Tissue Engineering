The concept of tissue engineering emerged after the successful implantation of a mouse tumor cell into a chick 
embryo. After that, several research organizations has showed an interest to experiment on human patient. In the early 1980, 
scientists were able to create artificial skin for the purpose of treating extensive burns (Kim and Evans, 2005). Today, artificial skin is being
applied in hospitals as a recognized treatment for burn patients.
 
In the United States, around 5,000 organ transplants are successfully performed in each year. But more than 6,500 people
that are on the waiting list for an organ transplantation  will die in that same time (American Transplant Foundation, 2016).
Due to the shortage of sufficient organs and complications that can occur during after the procedure, scientists claim that tissue 
engineering is a best approach to cure patients than organ transplantaion. 

Meanwhile, tissue engineering use and synthesizes theories, principles, and methods of bioengineering, material science and
life sciences for the production and restoration of tissues.The goal of this process is to renew tissues and restore the
affected organ through cell implantation and matrix incorporation into the patient (Kim and Evans, 2005). Tissue engineering uses
cells, scaffold, and growth factor to regenerate new tissues. This does not necessarily mean that all three tools are applied to
every organ. For example, bone tissue engineering needs morphogenetic protein to regenerate, while dermal tissue is
renewed without cell seeding and growth factor delivery (Ikada, 2006).

Generally, there are many areas where active research is conducted on tissue engineering. These areas include studies of cardiovascular 
tissues engineering with an emphasis on artificial heart muscle, blood vessels, valves, ventricles, and the whole bioartificial heart.
In addition researchers are also focusing on components of the musculoskeletal system such as bone, cartilage, skeletal muscle and 
tendons. The urinary system that consists of kidneys, urinary bladder, ureters and urethras is also included in tissue engineering. 
Tissue engineering of the respiratory system has focused on the production of artificial tracheas and artificial lung tissue. 
Tissue engineering for the digestive system has been focused on the development of artificial liver tissue, pancreas, intestine tissue 
and esophageal tissue. Researchers are also working in the development of artificial skin and attempting to solve issues 
related with central nervous system.
